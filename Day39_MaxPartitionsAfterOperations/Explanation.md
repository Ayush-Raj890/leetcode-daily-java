# Day 39 ‚Äì Maximum Partitions After Operations (LeetCode #2751)

## üß© Problem
You are given a string `s`. You can perform **at most one operation**:  
choose an index `i` and change `s[i]` to any lowercase English letter.  

After performing this operation **(or not performing at all)**, you must split the string into the **maximum number of partitions**,  
such that each partition contains **unique characters** (no duplicates within the same part).  

Return the **maximum number of partitions** possible.

---

## üí° Approach / Idea
- Traverse the string from left to right and count how many partitions are formed naturally.  
  (Whenever we find a repeated character, we start a new partition.)
- Since we are allowed **one character change**, we can strategically decide where to make that change to **maximize the total partitions**.

### Steps:
1. Traverse the string and track character frequencies to find partition points.  
2. Keep count of how many partitions we can form without any operation.  
3. Then, consider changing one character ‚Äî this could:
   - Break a large partition into two smaller ones.
   - Reduce the overlap caused by duplicate characters.
4. Try each position `i` as a potential change point and compute the result.
5. Return the **maximum partition count** among all possibilities.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n √ó 26)` ‚âà `O(n)`  
  (We check each character and simulate one replacement.)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(26)` = `O(1)`  
  (We only use a small frequency array for characters.)

## üß† Code (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPartitionsAfterOperations(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        int partitions = 1;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (freq[c - 'a'] == 1) {
                partitions++;
                freq = new int[26];
            }
            freq[c - 'a'] = 1;
        }
        int maxPartitions = partitions;
        // Try to simulate one change operation
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
            for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                if (ch == s.charAt(i)) continue;
                sb.setCharAt(i, ch);
                maxPartitions = Math.max(maxPartitions, countPartitions(sb.toString()));
            }
        }
        return maxPartitions;
    }

    private int countPartitions(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        int partitions = 1;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (freq[c - 'a'] == 1) {
                partitions++;
                freq = new int[26];
            }
            freq[c - 'a'] = 1;
        }
        return partitions;
    }
}

## üßæ Example / Output

**Input:**
`s = "accca"`

**Output:**
`3`

**Explanation:**

* Without change ‚Üí partitions = 2 (`"acc" | "ca"`)
* If we change `s[1] = 'b'` ‚Üí `"abc" | "ca"` gives **3 partitions**, which is maximum.

---

## ü™Ñ Summary / Insights

* The problem involves **string traversal** and **simulation** of one possible change.
* The trick is identifying partition boundaries based on duplicate characters.
* By testing all one-character modifications, we can find the optimal maximum partitions.

# Day 34 ‚Äì Magical Sum

## üß† Problem Understanding
We are given:
- An integer `m` representing the total number of selections.
- An integer `k` which determines the number of magical operations or conditions.
- An array `nums` of integers.

We need to calculate the total **‚Äúmagical sum‚Äù** formed by selecting elements and performing combinations based on bit counts and order of selection.  
The result should be returned **modulo 1e9+7**.

This problem involves:
- Combinatorics (factorials and inverse factorials)
- Modular exponentiation
- Dynamic programming to count valid combinations

---

## üßÆ Example
Input:
m = 3
k = 2
nums = [2, 3]

Output:
(Depends on combinations ‚Äî example is conceptual)

## üöÄ Approach

### 1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverse Factorials**
- Factorials are needed to compute combinations efficiently.
- Modular inverse is used since we're working under modulo `1e9+7`.

### 2. **Precompute Powers of Each Number**
- For each number in `nums`, calculate its powers up to `m` to avoid recomputation.

### 3. **Dynamic Programming (4D DP)**
`f[i][j][p][q]` represents:
- `i`: current index in `nums`
- `j`: total selections so far
- `p`: bit count information (accumulated)
- `q`: magical operation count

Transitions:
- Try selecting `r` elements from current number.
- Update `p` and `q` according to selection and bit count conditions.
- Accumulate results with modular arithmetic.

### 4. **Final Answer Calculation**
- Iterate over all `p` and `q`.
- If `bitcount(p) + q == k`, add to result.
- Multiply by `fac[m]` to account for permutations of selections.

## ‚è≥ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m^3 * k)` due to nested loops and state transitions.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * m * (2m+1) * k)` for DP array.

---

## üß† Key Concepts Used
- Modular exponentiation
- Factorials & Inverse Factorials
- Combinatorial DP
- Bit manipulation

---

## üèÜ Why This Works
- Precomputing factorials and powers avoids repeated calculations.
- DP ensures all valid magical combinations are counted.
- BitCount ensures magical operation conditions are enforced correctly.
- Modulo arithmetic ensures the result fits within integer limits.

---

## üßæ Final Notes
- Be careful with large DP states and memory.
- Use modulo operations at every step.
- This is a **hard** level combinatorial problem involving advanced DP.
